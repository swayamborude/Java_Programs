Welcome to Eclipse In Java, we can append a string in an existing file using FileWriter which has an option to open a file in append mode.
Java FileWriter class is used to write character-oriented data to a file.
It is a character-oriented class that is used for file handling in Java.
Unlike FileOutputStream class, we donâ€™t need to convert the string into a byte array because it provides a method to write a string directly.
